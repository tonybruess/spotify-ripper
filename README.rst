spotify-ripper |Version|
========================
A fork of
`spotify-ripper <https://github.com/jrnewell/spotify-ripper`__ that uses `spotipy <https://github.com/plamere/spotipy>`__ for WebAPI integration and playlist updating

***IMPORTANT*** Due to the playlist retreival method of libspotify (pyspotify library) no longer functioning, a spotify web api account is now required for playlist ripping and emptying
                please read the section below "Remove From Playlist Option" for instructions and tips on setting up a web api client and generating a token

                make sure you export the web api credentials in your unix shell
                export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='77aa1aa93dc0416397f22a7a9b4a815b'
                export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='0d79181c57ee412aaa770af257edf07a'
                export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI='http://www.purple.com'

Spotify-ripper is a small ripper script for Spotify that rips Spotify
URIs to audio files and includes ID3 tags and cover art.  By default spotify-ripper will encode to MP3 files, but includes the ability to rip to WAV, FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, AAC, and MP4/M4A.

**Note that stream ripping violates the libspotify's ToS**

Libspotify’s Deprecation
------------------------
**From Mopidy's documentation**

*Note that as of May 2015 libspotify is officially deprecated by Spotify and is no longer actively maintained.*

*Note that as of Jan 2016 Spotify may no longer be issuing developer keys.*

*Spotify has published newer libraries intended for Android and iOS development, as well as web APIs to access track metadata and manage playlists. Though, for making apps with Spotify playback capabilities, on any other platform than Android and iOS, there is currently no alternative to libspotify.*

*libspotify has been the main way of integrating with Spotify since 2009, and is today a part of numerous open source projects and commercial applications, including many receivers and even cars. There’s no guarantees, but one can hope that the large deployment of libspotify means that the library will continue to work with the Spotify service for a long time into the future.*

Features
--------

-  real-time VBR or CBR ripping from Spotify PCM stream

-  writes ID3v2/metadata tags (including album covers)

-  rips files into the following directory structure: ``artist/album/artist - song.mp3`` by default or optionally into a user-specified structure (see `Format String`_ section below)

-  option to skip or overwrite existing files

-  accepts tracks, playlists, albums, and artist URIs

-  search for tracks using Spotify queries

-  options for interactive login (no password in shell history) and
   to relogin using previous credentials

-  option to remove tracks from playlist after successful ripping

-  globally installs ripper script using setup.py

-  Python 2.7.x and 3.4.x compatible.  Python 3 will occasionally throw a ``NameError: name '_lock' is not defined`` exception at the end of the script due to an `upstream bug <https://github.com/mopidy/pyspotify/issues/133>`__ in ``pyspotify``.

-  use a config file to specify common command-line options

-  helpful progress bar to gauge the time remaining until completion

-  keep local files in sync with a Spotify playlist, m3u and wpl playlist file

-  option to rip to ALAC, a loseless codec, instead of MP3 (requires extra ``avconv`` dependency)

-  option to rip to FLAC, a loseless codec, instead of MP3 (requires extra ``flac`` dependency)

-  option to rip to AIFF, a loseless codec, instead of MP3 (requires extra ``sox`` dependency)

-  option to rip to Ogg Vorbis instead of MP3 (requires extra ``vorbis-tools`` dependency)

-  option to rip to Opus instead of MP3 (requires extra ``opus-tools`` dependency)

-  option to rip to AAC instead of MP3 (requires extra ``faac`` dependency)

-  option to rip to MP4/M4A instead of MP3 (requires compiling ``fdkaac``)

-  option to replace output filenames

-  option to normalize output filenames to NFKD (see http://unicode.org/faq/normalization.html)

**Please note: Spotify’s highest quality setting is 320 kbps, so the benefit of ripping to a lossless format is to not double encode the audio data. It’s not possible to rip in true lossless quality.**

Facebook Login
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spotify-ripper will work with your regular Facebook login/password if you setup your Spotify account to login using your Facebook credentials.  Otherwise, use your Spotify login/password.

Config File
~~~~~~~~~~~

For options that you want set on every run, you can use a config file named ``config.ini`` in the settings folder (defaults to ``~/.spotify-ripper``).  The options in the config file use the same name as the command line options with the exception that dashes are translated to ``snake_case``.  Any option specified in the command line will overwrite any setting in the config file.  Please put all options under a ``[main]`` section.

Here is an example config file

.. code:: ini

    [main]
    ascii = True
    format = {album_artist}/{album}/{artist} - {track_name}.{ext}
    quality = 160
    vorbis = True
    last = True

Format String
-------------

The format string dictates how ``spotify-ripper`` will organize your ripped files.  This is controlled through the ``-f | --format`` option.  The string should include the format of the file name and optionally a directory structure.   If you do not include a format string, the default format will be used: ``{album_artist}/{album}/{artist} - {track_name}.{ext}``.

The ``--flat`` option is shorthand for using the format string: ``{artist} - {track_name}.{ext}``, and the ``--flat-with-index`` option is shorthand for using the format string: ``{idx:3} - {artist} - {track_name}.{ext}``.  The use of these shorthand options will override any ``--format`` string option given.

Your format string can include the following variables names, which are case-sensitive and wrapped in curly braces, if you want your file/path name to be overwritten with Spotify metadata.

Format String Variables

Any substring in the format string that does not match a variable above will be passed through to the file/path name unchanged.

Zero-Filled Padding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Format variables that represent an index can be padded with zeros to a user-specified length.  For example, ``{idx:3}`` will produce the following output: 001, 002, 003, etc.  If no number is provided, no zero-filled padding will occur (e.g. 8, 9, 10, 11, ...). The variables that accept this option include ``{idx}``, ``{track_num}``, ``{disc_num}``, ``{smart_track_num}`` and their aliases.

Prefix String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Format variable ``feat_artists`` takes a prefix string to be prepended before the output.  For example, ``{feat_artists:featuring} will produce the follow output ``featuing Bruno Mars``.  If there are no featuring artists, the prefix string (and any preceding spaces) will not be included.

Playlist Sync Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, other than checking for an overwrite, ``spotify-ripper`` will not keep track of local files once they are ripped from Spotify.  However, if you use the ``--playlist-sync`` option when passing a playlist URI, ``spotify-ripper`` will store a json file in your settings directory that keeps track of location of your ripped files for that playlist.

If at a later time, the playlist is changed on Spotify (i.e. songs reordered, removed or added), ``spotify-ripper`` will try to keep your local files "in sync" the playlist if you rerun the same command.  For example, if your format string is ``{index} {artist} - {track_name}.{ext}``, it will rename is existing files so the index is correct.  Note that with option set, ``spotify-ripper`` will delete a song that was previously on the playlist, but was removed but still exists on your local machine.  It does not affect files outside of the playlist and has no effect on non-playlist URIs.

If you want to redownload a playlist (for example with improved quality), you either need to remove the song files from your local or use the ``--overwrite`` option.

Remove From Playlist Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since the work around to remove songs from a playlist uses the Spotify Web API, to enable --remove-from-playlist you must go through a few steps

1. Make an application at https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/ name it whatever you like

2. Generate and store you client_id and client_secret, you'll need these later

3. Add http://example.com to your applications Redirect URI's, make sure to click the green "ADD" button to the right of the field before pressing SAVE. Ensure the URI doesn't use https.
   
4. Press the "SAVE" button at the bottom of the page

5. Install this package if you haven't already and navigate to it in the python version you installed it with (I would  suggest Python 3 at least) For example, my installation directory is "/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/spotify_ripper/"
   
6. If you have been using spotify-ripper for a while, it probably doesn't have accurate cache data on your playlists anymore. Find your ".spotify-ripper" folder, most likely in your home directory, and delete your "Users" folder. It will be regenerated on the next run.

7. Finally, run `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='xxx' SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='xxx' SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI='http://example.com' spotify-ripper --remove-from-playlist ...`. When prompted, open the link it says it's opening for you in a web browser. Log into spotify, give it permission, and the copy the entire url it redirects to. Ensure you haven't typed any other characters into where it asks for the URL you were redirected to, paste the URL and press enter. For some reason, when run through SSH you won't see anything you type or paste into this field.

If you followed all of these steps correctly, spotify-ripper will completely empty the playlist you are ripping from when it finishes.

A couple notes about Spotify's WebAPI token authentication:

- The token is stored in a file named .profile-“username” without quotes

- The authentication token is stored where the script is executed from, so if you're in your home directory and execute a script thats in /usr/bin it will be stored in your home directory

- If you are running this in a script or other form of automation, you'll have to manually authenticate once but after that as long as you always execute it from the same location you won't have to authenticate again.

- Don't use a URL that redirects. You need to intercept the URL as is.

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

Recommend approach uses `homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__ and
`pyenv <https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv>`__

To install pyenv using homebrew:

.. code:: bash

    $ brew update
    $ brew install pyenv
    $ eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    ## the next line ensures 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' is run everytime terminal is opened
    $ echo 'if which pyenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(pyenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
    $ pyenv install 2.7.10  # or whatever version of python you want
    $ pyenv global 2.7.10
    $ python -V             # should say Python 2.7.10

To install spotify-ripper once pyenv is setup:

.. code:: bash

    $ brew install homebrew/binary/libspotify
    $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify.12.1.51.dylib \
        /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify
    $ brew install lame
    $ pip install git+https://github.com/SolidHal/spotify-ripper
    $ pyenv rehash

**Note that Spotify may no longer be issuing developer keys.** See `Libspotify’s Deprecation`_

Download an application key file ``spotify_appkey.key`` from
``https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/`` (requires a Spotify
Premium Account) and move the file to the ``~/.spotify-ripper`` directory (or use
the ``-k | --key`` option).

Ubuntu/Debian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recommend approach uses `pyenv <https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv>`__. If
you don't use pyenv, you need to install the ``python-dev`` package
too. If you are installing on the Raspberry Pi (gen 1), use the
`eabi-armv6hf
version <https://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-12.1.103-Linux-armv6-bcm2708hardfp-release.tar.gz>`__
of libspotify.

To install pyenv using `pyenv-installer <https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer>`__ (requires git and curl):

.. code:: bash

    $ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash
    ## restart terminal ##
    $ pyenv install 2.7.10  # or whatever version of python you want
    $ pyenv global 2.7.10
    $ python -V             # should say Python 2.7.10

To install spotify-ripper once pyenv is setup:

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install lame build-essential libffi-dev
    $ wget https://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-12.1.51-Linux-x86_64-release.tar.gz # (assuming 64-bit)
    $ tar xvf libspotify-12.1.51-Linux-x86_64-release.tar.gz
    $ cd libspotify-12.1.51-Linux-x86_64-release/
    $ sudo make install prefix=/usr/local
    $ pip install spotipy
    $ pip3 install git+https://github.com/SolidHal/spotify-ripper --upgrade
    $ pyenv rehash

**Note that Spotify may no longer be issuing developer keys.** See `Libspotify’s Deprecation`_

Download an application key file ``spotify_appkey.key`` from
``https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/`` (requires a Spotify
Premium Account) and move the file to the ``~/.spotify-ripper`` directory (or use
the ``-k | --key`` option).

Windows
~~~~~~~

Unfortunately, pyspotify seems to have an issue building on Windows (if someone can get this to work, please let me know). The best alternative is to run a linux distribution in a virtual machine.  Basic instructions to install Ubuntu on Virtual Box can be found in the `wiki <https://github.com/hbashton-ripper/wiki/Windows>`__.


Optional Encoding Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to MP3 encoding, ``spotify-ripper`` supports encoding to FLAC, AAC, MP4/M4A, Ogg Vorbis and Opus.  However, additional encoding tools need to be installed for each codec you wish to use.

**Mac OS X**

.. code:: bash

    # FLAC
    $ brew install flac

    # ALAC
    $ brew install libav

    # AAC
    $ brew install faac

    # MP4/M4A
    $ brew install fdk-aac-encoder

    # Ogg Vorbis
    $ brew install vorbis-tools

    # Opus
    $ brew install opus-tools

    # SoX
    $ brew install sox

**Ubuntu/Debian**

.. code:: bash

    # FLAC
    $ sudo apt-get install flac

    # ALAC
    $ sudo apt-get install libav-tools

    # AAC
    $ sudo apt-get install faac

    # MP4/M4A (need to compile fdkaac from source)
    $ sudo apt-get install libfdk-aac-dev automake autoconf
    $ wget https://github.com/nu774/fdkaac/archive/v0.6.2.tar.gz
    $ tar xvf v0.6.2.tar.gz
    $ cd fdkaac-0.6.2
    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure
    $ sudo make install

    # Ogg Vorbis
    $ sudo apt-get install vorbis-tools

    # Opus
    $ sudo apt-get install opus-tools

    # SoX
    $ sudo apt-get install install sox
